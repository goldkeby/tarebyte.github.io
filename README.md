## A moment of thanks
I'd like to thank [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman), I borrowed the look of [his site](http://zachholman.com), but this code is all of my own.

## Please be kind
I really enjoy using the symbolset icons on my site, and I also enjoy keeping this website open source.
Please don't steal them. I bought them, and I would appreciate it if you did the same.

You can buy the set [here](https://symbolset.com/icons/social-circle);
